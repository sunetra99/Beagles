			<h4 class="heading2">11th Century</h4>
			<p class="para1">The modern breed was developed in Great Britain around the 1830s from 
				<br>
				several breeds, including the Talbot Hound, the North Country Beagle, the Southern
				<br>
				 Hound, and possibly  the Harrier.The origin of the beagle is not known.  
				<br>
				In the 11th century, William the Conqueror brought the St. Hubert Hound and the 
				<br>
				 Talbot hound to Britain. In Britain both of these strains were then crossed 
				 <br>
				 with Greyhounds to give them speed and stamina for deer hunting.Beagles are 
				 <br>
				 similar to the Harrier and the extinct Southern Hound, though smaller 
				 <br>
				and slower. Miniature breeds of beagle-type dogs were known from the times  
				<br>
				of Edward II and Henry VII,who both had packs of Glove Beagles, so named since 
				<br>
				 they were small enough to fit on a glove, and Queen Elizabeth I kept a breed 
				 <br>
				 known as a Pocket Beagle, which stood 8 to 9 inches  (20 to 23 cm) at the shoulder.  
				 <br>
				 Small enough to fit in a "pocket" or saddlebag, they rode along on the hunt.

			<h4 class="heading3">18th Century</h4>
			<p class="para2">
				By the 18th century two breeds had been developed for hunting hare and rabbit:
				<br>
				 the Southern Hound and the North Country Beagle (or Northern Hound). 
				 <br>
				 The Southern Hound, a tall, heavy dog with a square head, and long, soft ears,
				 <br>
				  was common from south of the River Trent and probably closely related to the
				  <br> 
				  Talbot Hound. Though slow, it had stamina and an excellent scenting ability.
				  <br> 
				  The North Country Beagle, possibly a cross between an offshoot of the Talbot 
				  <br>
				  stock and a Greyhound, was bred chiefly in Yorkshire and was common in the 
				  <br>
				  northern counties. It was smaller than the Southern Hound, less heavy-set and 
				  <br>
				  with a more pointed muzzle. It was faster than its southern counterpart but
				  <br> 
				  its scenting abilities were less well developed.

			<h4 class="heading4">EXPORT TO THE STATES 1840'S</h4>
			<p class="para3">
				Beagles were in the United States by the 1840s at the latest, 
				<br> 
				but the first dogs were imported strictly for hunting and were 
				<br>
				of variable quality. Since Honeywood had only started breeding 
				<br>
				in the 1830s, it is unlikely these dogs were representative of
				<br> 
				the modern breed and the description of them as looking like
				<br> 
				straight-legged Dachshunds with weak heads has little resemblance 
				<br>
				to the standard. Serious attempts at establishing a quality bloodline 
				<br>
				began in the early 1870s when General Richard Rowett from Illinois
				<br>
			    imported some dogs from England and began breeding. Rowett's Beagles
			    <br>
			    are believed to have formed the models for the first American standard,
			    <br>
			    drawn up by Rowett, L. H. Twadell, and Norman Ellmore in 1887.
			    <br> 
			    The beagle was accepted as a breed by the American Kennel Club (AKC)
			    <br>
			    in 1885. In the 20th century the breed has spread worldwide.

			<h4 class="heading3">POPULARITY</h4>
			<p class="para2">
				The National Beagle Club of America was formed in 1888 and by
				<br>
				1901 a beagle had won a Best in Show title. As in the UK,
				<br>
				activity during World War I was minimal, but the breed showed
				<br> 
				a much stronger revival in the U.S. when hostilities ceased.
				<br> 
				In 1928 it won a number of prizes at the Westminster Kennel
				<br> 
				Club's show and by 1939 a beagle – Champion Meadowlark Draughtsman
				<br> 
				had captured the title of top-winning American-bred dog for the year.
				<br>
				On 12 February 2008, a beagle, K-Run's Park Me In First (Uno),
				<br>
				won the Best In Show category at the Westminster Kennel Club show
				<br> 
			    for the first time in the competition's history. In North America
			    <br> 
				they have been consistently in the top-ten most-popular breeds for
				<br>
				over 30 years. From 1953 to 1959 the beagle was ranked No. 1 on the
				<br>
				list of the American Kennel Club's registered breeds; in 2005 and
				<br>
				2006 it ranked 5th out of the 155 breeds registered. In the UK
				<br> 
				they are not quite so popular, placing 28th and 30th in the rankings
				<br>
				of registrations with the Kennel Club in 2005 and 2006 respectively.
				<br> 
				In the United States the beagle ranked 4th most popular breed in
				<br>
				2012 and 2013, behind the Labrador Retriever (#1), German Shepherd
				<br> 
				(#2) and Golden Retriever (#3) breeds.

			<h4 class="heading2">APPEARANCE</h4>
			<p class="para1">The general appearance of the beagle resembles a miniature Foxhound,
			<br>
			but the head is broader and the muzzle shorter, the expression completely
			<br>
			different and the legs shorter in proportion to the body.[25] They are
			<br>
			generally between 13 and 16 inches (33 and 41 cm) high at the withers
			<br> 
			and weigh between 18 and 35 lb (8.2 and 15.9 kg), with females being
			<br> 
			slightly smaller than males on average.The tricolored beagle—white with
			<br> 
			large black areas and light brown shading—is the most common. Tricolored
			<br>
			 beagles occur in a number of shades, from the "Classic Tri" with a jet
			 <br> 
			 black saddle (also known as "Blackback"), to the "Dark Tri"
			 <br> 
		    (where faint brown markings are intermingled with more prominent black markings)
		    <br>, 
		    to the "Faded Tri" (where faint black markings are intermingled with more prominent
		    <br>
		    brown markings). Some tricolored dogs have a broken pattern, sometimes referred to
		    <br>
		    as pied. These dogs have mostly white coats with patches of black and brown hair.
		    <br>
		   Tricolor beagles are almost always born black and white. The white areas are
		   <br>
		   typically set by eight weeks, but the black areas may fade to brown as the puppy matures.
